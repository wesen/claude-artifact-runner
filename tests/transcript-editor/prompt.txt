You will analyze a transcript (such as from an interview, podcast, video, or presentation) and extract targeted information about specific topics, creating a structured JSON output with detailed analysis.

## Input
- A transcript of spoken content with timestamps in HH:MM:SS format
- A list of specific topics to focus on (e.g., "AI ethics", "climate solutions", "educational technology")

## Output Format
Create a JSON structure with these components:
1. "specific_topics": An array of the requested topics found in the transcript
2. "general_topics": An array of all significant topics identified in the transcript

For each topic, include:
- "name": A concise topic title
- "information": A detailed summary of what was discussed
- "key_quotes": 4-6 representative quotes from the transcript
- "time_ranges": An array of time ranges where this topic appears (can include multiple segments)

## Approach
Let's think step by step:

1. **Initial Reading**: First, read through the entire transcript to get a comprehensive understanding.

2. **General Topic Identification**:
   - Break down the transcript into logical segments based on content shifts
   - For each segment, identify what general topic is being discussed
   - Note the start and end timestamps for each segment
   - Merge segments discussing the same topic, even if they're non-consecutive

3. **Specific Topic Analysis**:
   - For each requested topic, search throughout the transcript
   - Extract relevant segments, even if they appear in multiple places
   - Go beyond keyword matching to understand conceptual discussions of the topic
   - Identify segments that relate to the topic even if not explicitly mentioned

4. **Quote Selection**:
   - Choose the most insightful, clear, and representative quotes
   - Prefer quotes that capture the essence of the topic
   - Include quotes that show different aspects or perspectives within the topic
   - Maintain accurate quotation with minimal editing

5. **Information Synthesis**:
   - Write a comprehensive summary of each topic's treatment in the transcript
   - Synthesize points made across different segments
   - Focus on insights, patterns, and key arguments rather than just repeating content
   - Keep summaries objective and faithful to the original content

6. **Final Structure**:
   - Format everything according to the requested JSON structure
   - Verify all timestamps are accurate and in proper format
   - Ensure quotes are accurately transcribed
   - Check that all requested topics are addressed if they appear in the transcript

## Detailed Analysis Process

When analyzing the transcript, follow these more detailed guidelines:

### For Identifying Topics
1. Look for explicit topic changes signaled by phrases like "moving on to," "let's talk about," or "another thing is"
2. Notice when the speaker introduces new concepts, technologies, theories, or examples
3. Pay attention to shifts in tone, energy, or level of detail that might signal a topic change
4. Consider how smaller subtopics relate to larger themes

### For Extracting Time Ranges
1. Mark when a topic is first introduced
2. Track when the conversation returns to previously mentioned topics
3. Note when a topic is concluded or transitions to another
4. Merge adjacent or overlapping time segments about the same topic

### For Selecting Key Quotes
1. Prioritize quotes that define or explain the topic
2. Include quotes that provide unique insights or perspectives
3. Select quotes that demonstrate the speaker's expertise or personal experience
4. Choose quotes that are concise and self-contained when possible

The conversation also touched on the growing movement of AI researchers advocating for cautious and thoughtful deployment, especially for technologies with significant societal impact. The speakers concluded that meaningful ethics requires structural changes in how technology is developed, not just surface-level policies.",
      "key_quotes": [
        "The problem with most ethics boards is they're set up to advise but have no actual power to stop a product launch when they identify serious concerns.",
        "We're seeing this cycle where companies rush to market, apologize for the damage later, and treat the PR fallout as just a cost of doing business.",
        "There's a fundamental tension between maximizing shareholder value and truly serving the public interest that tech companies haven't resolved.",
        "What gives me hope is seeing more engineers and researchers speaking up from inside these companies - they're unwilling to just build whatever they're told to without considering consequences.",
        "The shift from 'move fast and break things' to 'move carefully and fix things' is happening, but far too slowly given what's at stake."

## Additional Guidelines

### Handling Complex Transcripts
- For longer transcripts, focus on identifying major themes first, then drill down into specifics
- When topics interweave or overlap significantly, prioritize clarity in your analysis
- If speakers disagree about a topic, capture multiple perspectives in your summary
- For technical content, ensure your topic summaries accurately reflect specialized terminology

### Addressing Ambiguity
- If a topic appears to be discussed but is unclear, note this in your summary
- When timestamps are unclear or missing, provide your best estimate and note uncertainty
- If a requested topic isn't discussed in the transcript, include it in your specific_topics list but note its absence
- For topics that are mentioned very briefly, indicate the limited treatment in your summary

### Handling Multiple Speakers
- Attribute quotes to specific speakers when possible and relevant
- Note significant differences in expertise or perspective among speakers
- Capture dynamics between speakers (agreement, disagreement, building on ideas)
- Distinguish between presenter content and audience questions if applicable

Remember to remain objective in your analysis, avoid inserting opinions not present in the transcript, and focus on creating a comprehensive and accurate representation of the content.
